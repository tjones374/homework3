This is an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria.
The user is prompted to choose from the following password criteria:

- Length (must be between 8 and 128 characters)

- Character type:
  - Special characters
  - Numeric characters
  - Lowercase characters
  - Uppercase characters

The application validates the user input and ensures that at least one character type is selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the user is presented with a password matching the answered prompts.
The generated password is then written to the page for the user to copy to the clipboard.
